{% block question %}
Consider a thin ring of charge $Q$ and radius $R$. $P$ is a point that lies along the axis of the ring, and let $x$ be the distance between $P$ and the centre of the ring. Create an expression for the electric field strength acting on the point $P$ due to the ring, in terms of $R$, $x$, and $Q$.
